# ReactJS
ReactJS Basics
## What is React
-   React is a Javascript library created by Facebook and is used for building user interfaces (UIs) and front-end applications.
-   React is often called a framework because of its behaviour and capabilities.
-   React is the most popular framework in the industry (for now)

## Create React App
To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app myapp
```
OR

### npm

```sh
npm install create-react-app

create-react-app myapp
```
It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
myapp
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js
```
No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
Please install these extensions in visual studio code, these will really healp us in the development.

## Components
A website consists of several comonents as shown below:

Each componenets plays its own role.
In ReactJS **App.js** acts as the root components, and all other components will pe placed in the root component.

There are two types of components in React
1. Functional Component
2. Class Component

#### Functional Components
These components are purely presentational and are simply represented by a function that optionally takes props and returns a React element to be rendered to the page.
-   **Functional** because they are basically functions
-   **Stateless** because they do not hold and/or manage state
-   **Presentational** because all they do is output UI elements

Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
function FunctionalComponentExample() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
export default FunctionalComponentExample
```
## Functional Components vs CLass Components
## State
## Props
